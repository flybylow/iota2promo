# Project Setup: IOTA Hackathon Team Page

**Date:** 18 February 2026

## Overview

Created the initial project structure for the Masterz x IOTA EU hackathon team promotion page.

## Files Created

- `index.html` - Main website file (single-page HTML with inline CSS)
- `docs/prd-iota-hackathon-team-page.md` - Product Requirements Document
- `docs/rules.md` - Project rules and guidelines
- `docs/project-setup.md` - This file

## Key Decisions

1. **Single-file approach**: Using a single `index.html` with inline CSS for simplicity and easy deployment
2. **No build tools**: Keeping it lightweight - just HTML/CSS, no frameworks or build processes
3. **Mobile-first responsive**: Grid layouts stack at 600px breakpoint
4. **Typography**: IBM Plex Sans (sans) and IBM Plex Mono (mono) from Google Fonts
5. **Design evolution**: Starting with B&W wireframe, will layer in IOTA brand colors progressively

## Next Steps

- [ ] Fill in Stephanos and Omar's roles/locations
- [x] Hackathon name confirmed: Masterz x IOTA EU hackathon
- [ ] Deploy to hosting (Vercel/Netlify suggested)
- [ ] Week 2: Add IOTA brand colors and visual styling
- [ ] Continue adding build log entries weekly
