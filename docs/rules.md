# Project Rules and Guidelines

**Date:** 18 February 2026

## Documentation Organization

**Rule #1: Documentation Location**
- All documentation files (`.md`, `.txt`, etc.) must be stored in the `docs/` folder
- Never place documentation files in the project root
- The `docs/` folder serves as the personal knowledge database for everything we learn during development
